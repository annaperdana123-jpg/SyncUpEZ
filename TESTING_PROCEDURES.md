# SyncUp SaaS Application Testing Procedures and Best Practices

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive testing procedures and best practices for the SyncUp SaaS application. It covers all aspects of testing including unit tests, integration tests, multi-tenancy verification, data integrity checks, and performance evaluation.

## Testing Structure

The application follows a two-tiered testing approach:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual services and middleware components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test complete API endpoints and workflows

```

## Running Tests

### Available Test Scripts

The application provides several npm scripts for testing:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (useful during development)
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Execution Environment

Tests are configured to run in a Node.js environment with Jest as the test runner. The configuration is specified in `package.json`:

```json
"jest": {
  "testEnvironment": "node",
  "collectCoverageFrom": [
    "src/**/*.js",
    "!src/index.js"
  ]
}
```

## Test Data Management

### Test Data Factory

The application uses a test data factory (`test/testDataFactory.js`) to generate consistent mock data with unique identifiers for test isolation.

### Unique Identifiers

Each test run uses unique identifiers generated with timestamps to ensure test isolation:

```javascript
const timestamp = Date.now();
const mockEmployee = {
  employee_id: `emp_test_${timestamp}`,
  email: `test${timestamp}@example.com`,
  // ... other properties
};
```

## Unit Testing Approach

### Service Layer Testing

Services are tested by mocking their dependencies, particularly file I/O operations:

```javascript
// Example from analyticsService.test.js
jest.mock('../src/utils/csvReader', () => ({
  readCSV: jest.fn((filePath) => {
    // Return mock data based on the file path
    if (filePath.includes('employees.csv')) {
      return Promise.resolve([
        { employee_id: 'emp1', name: 'John Doe', team: 'TeamA', department: 'DeptA' }
      ]);
    }
    // ... other file mocks
    return Promise.resolve([]);
  })
}));
```

### Middleware Testing

Middleware components are tested by creating mock request, response, and next function objects:

```javascript
// Example from authMiddleware.test.js
const mockRequest = {
  headers: {
    authorization: 'Bearer valid-token'
  }
};

const mockResponse = {
  status: jest.fn().mockReturnThis(),
  json: jest.fn()
};

const mockNext = jest.fn();
```

## Integration Testing Approach

Integration tests use Supertest to make actual HTTP requests to the Express application without starting a server:

```javascript
// Example from integration.test.js
const request = require('supertest');
const app = require('../server');

test('should create a new employee', async () => {
  const response = await request(app)
    .post('/api/employees')
    .send(mockEmployee)
    .expect(201);
  
  expect(response.body).toHaveProperty('message', 'Employee created successfully');
});
```

## SaaS-Specific Testing

### Multi-Tenancy Testing

Since the application is a multi-tenant SaaS platform, tests must verify:

1. **Tenant Isolation**: Data from one tenant should not be accessible by another tenant
2. **Tenant Context**: All operations should be scoped to the correct tenant
3. **Provisioning**: Tenant creation and deletion should work correctly

### Authentication with Tenant Context

Tests should verify that JWT tokens include tenant context and that authentication properly scopes access to tenant data.

## Testing Different Components

### 1. Authentication Testing

- Test user registration and login
- Verify JWT token generation and validation
- Ensure unauthorized access is properly rejected
- Test tenant context in authentication tokens

### 2. Employee Management Testing

- Test creating, reading, updating, and deleting employees
- Verify proper data validation
- Ensure tenant isolation in employee data

### 3. Interaction Tracking Testing

- Test creating and retrieving interactions
- Verify interaction categorization
- Ensure proper pagination

### 4. Kudos System Testing

- Test sending and receiving kudos
- Verify kudos metrics calculation
- Ensure proper validation

### 5. Contribution Scoring Testing

- Test adding and retrieving contribution scores
- Verify score calculation algorithms
- Ensure historical data tracking

### 6. Analytics Testing

- Test employee metrics calculation
- Verify team and department metrics
- Ensure proper aggregation of data
- Test top contributors ranking

### 7. Backup System Testing

- Test creating tenant-specific backups
- Verify backup restoration
- Ensure backup scheduling works

### 8. CSV Data Integrity Testing

Since the application relies entirely on CSV files for data storage, special attention should be paid to data integrity:

1. **File Append Operations**: Test that concurrent writes don't corrupt data
2. **Data Consistency**: Verify that data reads match what was written
3. **File Locking**: Ensure proper file locking mechanisms prevent race conditions
4. **Error Recovery**: Test how the application handles corrupted CSV files
5. **Empty Line Handling**: Verify proper handling of newlines and empty lines at file ends

## Multi-Tenancy Testing

### Tenant Isolation Testing

To ensure proper data isolation between tenants, implement tests that:

1. Create data in one tenant
2. Verify that data is not accessible from another tenant
3. Confirm that operations in one tenant do not affect another tenant's data

### Tenant Provisioning Testing

Test the complete tenant lifecycle:

1. Creating new tenants
2. Verifying tenant data directories are created
3. Ensuring tenant configuration is properly set
4. Testing tenant deletion and cleanup

### Authentication Context Testing

Verify that JWT tokens contain the correct tenant context:

```javascript
// Test that tokens include tenant information
test('should include tenant context in JWT', async () => {
  const response = await request(app)
    .post('/api/auth/login')
    .send(credentials)
    .expect(200);
  
  const decoded = jwt.verify(response.body.token, process.env.JWT_SECRET);
  expect(decoded).toHaveProperty('tenantId', expectedTenantId);
});
```

## Performance Testing

Performance tests evaluate the application under expected load:

1. **Concurrent Requests**: Test handling of multiple simultaneous requests
2. **Large Data Sets**: Test performance with large data collections
3. **Response Times**: Ensure consistent response times under load
4. **Resource Usage**: Monitor memory and CPU usage during tests

## Test Coverage Recommendations

To ensure comprehensive testing of the SaaS application, the following areas should be covered:

1. **API Endpoints**: All routes should have integration tests
2. **Business Logic**: All service functions should have unit tests
3. **Middleware**: All middleware should be tested for correct behavior
4. **Error Handling**: Error conditions should be tested
5. **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and unusual inputs should be tested
6. **Tenant Isolation**: Cross-tenant data access should be explicitly tested
7. **Data Integrity**: CSV file operations should be tested for consistency

## Testing Environment Setup

### Local Development Environment

1. **Dependencies**: Ensure Node.js is installed (version specified in package.json)
2. **Environment Variables**: Copy `.env.local` to `.env.test` and adjust values for testing
3. **Data Directories**: Ensure test data directories are properly configured
4. **Port Configuration**: Use a different port for test servers to avoid conflicts

### Environment-Specific Configuration

The application uses different configurations for different environments:

- **Development**: Uses `.env.local` configuration
- **Testing**: Should use `.env.test` configuration
- **Production**: Uses environment variables set by deployment platform

Ensure each environment has the correct values for:
- Data directory paths
- JWT secrets
- Port configurations
- Logging levels

## Continuous Integration

For CI/CD pipelines, the following approach is recommended:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Run all tests
npm test

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use Descriptive Test Names**: Test names should clearly describe what is being tested
2. **Test One Thing**: Each test should focus on a single behavior or functionality
3. **Keep Tests Independent**: Tests should not depend on the execution order or state from other tests
4. **Mock External Dependencies**: File I/O and network calls should be mocked
5. **Clean Up Test Data**: Ensure tests don't leave behind artifacts
6. **Use Test Factories**: Create helper functions to generate test data
7. **Test Both Happy and Sad Paths**: Test both successful and error conditions
8. **Use Unique Identifiers**: Ensure test isolation with timestamp-based IDs
9. **Verify Tenant Isolation**: Explicitly test multi-tenancy boundaries
10. **Check Data Integrity**: Verify CSV operations maintain data consistency

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### 1. Tests Failing Due to Data Contamination

Ensure each test uses unique identifiers and that test data is properly cleaned up.

### 2. Authentication Tests Failing

Verify that JWT secrets are properly configured in the test environment.

### 3. CSV File Access Issues

Ensure mock implementations properly simulate file I/O operations.

### 4. Tenant Isolation Failures

Verify that tenant middleware is properly applied and that data operations are scoped correctly.
