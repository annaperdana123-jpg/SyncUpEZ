├── performance/          # Performance and load tests
├── edge-cases/           # Edge case and error handling tests
├── backup-restore/       # Backup and restoration tests
└── helpers/              # Test helpers and utilities
```

## Test Categories

### 1. Unit Tests

Unit tests focus on testing individual components in isolation:

- **Services**: Test business logic in service layers
- **Middleware**: Test authentication, tenant resolution, data isolation, and validation middleware
- **Utilities**: Test CSV readers/writers, tenant utilities, and other helper functions

### 2. Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that different parts of the application work together correctly:

- **Authentication API**: Test user registration, login, and token validation
- **Employee Management API**: Test CRUD operations for employees
- **Interaction Tracking API**: Test recording and retrieving employee interactions
- **Kudos System API**: Test sending and receiving kudos between employees
- **Contribution Scoring API**: Test adding and retrieving contribution scores
- **Analytics API**: Test analytics and reporting functionality
- **Tenant Management API**: Test multi-tenant functionality

### 3. Multi-Tenancy Tests

Multi-tenancy tests ensure proper data isolation between tenants:

- **Tenant Isolation**: Verify that tenants cannot access each other's data
- **Context Validation**: Ensure JWT tokens contain correct tenant context

### 4. Data Integrity Tests

Data integrity tests ensure data consistency and validation:

- **CSV Operations**: Test file append operations, data consistency, file locking, error recovery, and empty line handling
- **Data Validation**: Test validation of all input data including edge cases

### 5. Security Tests

Security tests validate authentication and authorization:

- **Authentication**: Test user registration and login, JWT token generation and validation
- **Authorization**: Test tenant data isolation, role-based access control, and proper error responses

### 6. Performance Tests

Performance tests evaluate application performance under load:

- **Load Testing**: Test handling of concurrent requests
- **Large Data Sets**: Test performance with large data collections
- **Response Times**: Ensure consistent response times under load

### 7. Edge Case Tests

Edge case tests handle boundary conditions and error handling:

- **Boundary Conditions**: Test maximum and minimum length inputs, special characters
- **Error Handling**: Test graceful handling of database errors, network timeouts, and concurrent requests
- **Invalid Inputs**: Test handling of invalid JSON, unexpected HTTP methods, and invalid URL parameters

### 8. Backup/Restore Tests

Backup/restore tests verify backup and restoration functionality:

- **Backup Functionality**: Test creating backups and listing available backups
- **Restore Functionality**: Test restoring from backups
- **Data Integrity**: Ensure data consistency during backup and restore operations

## Test Execution

### Available Test Scripts

The application provides several npm scripts for testing:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (useful during development)
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Test Coverage Requirements

The application has configured coverage thresholds in `package.json`:

```json
"coverageThreshold": {
  "global": {
    "branches": 80,
    "functions": 80,
    "lines": 80,
    "statements": 80
  }
}
```

## CI/CD Integration

For CI/CD pipelines, the following approach is recommended:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm ci

# Run all tests
npm test

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

## Testing Best Practices

1. **Use Descriptive Test Names**: Test names should clearly describe what is being tested
2. **Test One Thing**: Each test should focus on a single behavior or functionality
3. **Keep Tests Independent**: Tests should not depend on the execution order or state from other tests
4. **Mock External Dependencies**: File I/O and network calls should be mocked
5. **Clean Up Test Data**: Ensure tests don't leave behind artifacts
6. **Use Test Factories**: Create helper functions to generate test data
7. **Test Both Happy and Sad Paths**: Test both successful and error conditions
8. **Use Unique Identifiers**: Ensure test isolation with timestamp-based IDs
9. **Verify Tenant Isolation**: Explicitly test multi-tenancy boundaries
10. **Check Data Integrity**: Verify CSV operations maintain data consistency

## Test Data Management

The application uses a test data factory to generate consistent mock data with unique identifiers for test isolation. Each test run uses unique identifiers generated with timestamps to ensure test isolation.

## Monitoring and Troubleshooting

### Test Monitoring

- Monitor test execution times
- Track test coverage metrics
- Monitor for flaky tests
- Track test failures and trends

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **Tests Failing Due to Data Contamination**: Ensure each test uses unique identifiers and that test data is properly cleaned up.
2. **Authentication Tests Failing**: Verify that JWT secrets are properly configured in the test environment.
3. **CSV File Access Issues**: Ensure mock implementations properly simulate file I/O operations.
4. **Tenant Isolation Failures**: Verify that tenant middleware is properly applied and that data operations are scoped correctly.
