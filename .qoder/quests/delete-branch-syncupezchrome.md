# Delete Branch SyncUpEZChrome

## Overview

This document outlines the procedure for deleting the Git branch named "SyncUpEZChrome" from the repository. This is a standard Git maintenance task to remove unused or obsolete branches from the codebase.

## Prerequisites

- Git installed on the local machine
- Repository cloned locally
- Appropriate permissions to delete branches from the remote repository
- Current working directory is the project root

## Procedure

### 1. Verify Branch Existence

First, confirm that the branch "SyncUpEZChrome" exists in both local and remote repositories:

```bash
# List all local branches
git branch

# List all remote branches
git branch -r

# List all branches (local and remote)
git branch -a
```

### 2. Switch to a Different Branch

Before deleting any branch, ensure you are not currently on the branch to be deleted:

```bash
# Switch to main branch
git checkout main

# Or switch to another appropriate branch
git checkout <other-branch-name>
```

### 3. Delete Local Branch

Delete the local copy of the branch:

```bash
# Delete the local branch (safe deletion - will fail if branch has unmerged changes)
git branch -d SyncUpEZChrome

# Force delete the local branch (use with caution)
git branch -D SyncUpEZChrome
```

### 4. Delete Remote Branch

Delete the branch from the remote repository:

```bash
# Delete the remote branch
git push origin --delete SyncUpEZChrome

# Alternative syntax
git push origin :SyncUpEZChrome
```

### 5. Clean Up Local References

Clean up local references to remote branches:

```bash
# Prune remote-tracking branches that no longer exist on the remote
git remote prune origin
```

### 6. Verify Deletion

Confirm that the branch has been successfully deleted:

```bash
# Verify local branch deletion
git branch

# Verify remote branch deletion
git branch -r

# Fetch latest information from remote
git fetch --prune
```

## Risk Assessment

### Potential Risks

1. **Data Loss**: If the branch contains unique work not merged elsewhere, deleting it will permanently remove that work
2. **Collaboration Impact**: Other team members may be using the branch, causing their workflows to break
3. **Incorrect Branch**: Accidentally deleting the wrong branch

### Mitigation Strategies

1. **Verify Branch Contents**: Before deletion, review the branch contents and ensure all valuable work has been merged or backed up
2. **Team Communication**: Notify team members before deleting shared branches
3. **Double-check Commands**: Carefully review commands before execution to ensure correct branch name

## Best Practices

1. **Branch Hygiene**: Regularly delete merged or obsolete branches to maintain a clean repository
2. **Communication**: Inform team members before deleting shared branches
3. **Backup**: If unsure about the branch contents, create a backup before deletion
4. **Verification**: Always verify branch deletion to ensure the operation was successful

## Rollback Procedure

If the branch deletion was accidental and the branch needs to be recovered:

### 1. Recover from Reflog

Find the deleted branch in Git reflog:

```bash
# View reflog to find the deleted branch
git reflog

# Look for entries related to the deleted branch
# The format will be similar to: "branch: Deleted branch SyncUpEZChrome"
```

### 2. Recreate the Branch

Recreate the branch from the commit hash found in reflog:

```bash
# Create a new branch pointing to the commit
git branch SyncUpEZChrome <commit-hash>

# Switch to the recovered branch
git checkout SyncUpEZChrome
```

### 3. Push to Remote

Push the recovered branch to remote repository:

```bash
# Push the recovered branch to remote
git push origin SyncUpEZChrome
```

## Testing

No automated testing is required for this Git maintenance task. Manual verification of the deletion process is sufficient.
